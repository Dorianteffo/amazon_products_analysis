# Amazon products analysis 
In this project, we analyzed the KPIs of the TOP Amazon manufacturers. 
The notebook file amazon_product_analysis.ipynb contains more details about the project and the entire analysis. 
(warning : the two plots made with the plotly library(distribution of price and distribution of number of reviews) are missing from the notebook,  you can check those in the same notebook on my Kaggle  https://www.kaggle.com/code/doriancurtis/amazon-products-analysis/notebook)
